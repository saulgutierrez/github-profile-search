# github-profile-search

Simple web application for search a Github profile, entered the username in the platform, you can get some basic information about an specific profile, like the amount of followers, following, and some of their public repositories. You can see besides, the public profile picture, about, the name and the description of every public repository. With a tiny description of each project, the main language that is building by, and the amount of stars that are avaliable. <br>
I use the public GitHub API for fetch every data showed, and can access to every public repo. <br>
If you click on the name of one, they are direct links, bring you to the original directory on GitHub.
